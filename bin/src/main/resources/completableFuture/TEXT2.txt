The bedroom is smaller than the living-room and not so light as there is only one window in it. In this room there are two beds.  An alarm-clock and a small lamp with a pink lamp-shade are on the table. In the left-hand corner there is a dressing-table with a big mirror.. In this room we have a built-in wardrobe with coat-hangers to-hang clothes on. There is a thick carpet on the floor and plain light-brown curtains on the window. The third room is my study. It is not large but very cosy. There isn't much furniture in it, only the most necessary. It has a writing-table and an armchair before it. In the right-hand corner there is a bookcase full of books, magazines and newspapers. A small table with a radio is standing in the left-hand corner. Near it there is a sofa with some cushions. In my opinion, the study is the best room in our flat.
